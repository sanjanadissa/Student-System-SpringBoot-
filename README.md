ðŸ“˜ Student Management Form (React + Spring Boot)
This project is a full-stack student registration form built using:

Frontend: React.js (with MUI for UI design)

Backend: Spring Boot (Java REST API)

Database: (You can mention MySQL/PostgreSQL/H2 if used)

âœ¨ Features:
Add a new student with name and address

Sends data to the backend using a POST API

Uses Material UI (MUI) for clean and responsive design

Handles cross-origin requests with CORS support (@CrossOrigin in Spring Boot)

ðŸš€ How it works:
User fills in the form in the React app.

On clicking Send, the form data is sent via a fetch() POST request to http://localhost:8080/student/add.

Spring Boot receives and stores/processes the student data.

ðŸ›  Setup:
Run the Spring Boot backend on port 8080

Run the React app on port 3000

Make sure CORS is enabled using @CrossOrigin in your controller.
